# NonIdealReactorApp

`NonIdealReactorApp` is a MATLAB application for teaching and studying non-ideal reactors through RTD-based analysis, reactor-performance prediction, equivalent-model interpretation, and design-oriented comparison tools. The current app covers `RTD Analysis`, direct and one-parameter prediction-model routes, and a `Design & Optimization` workspace built on top of the selected RTD, reaction system, and feed stream.

This project extends the original `ReactorApp` line developed at the University of Alicante. The current non-ideal-reactor branch keeps that educational spirit while adding RTD-driven prediction routes, visualization layers, session persistence, and a design workspace for fitting, reactive comparison, and process-side optimization.

## Requirements

- MATLAB with support for `uifigure`-based apps
- A local copy of this project extracted from the distributed ZIP package

## Installation and Launch

There is no installer. Use the project as a normal MATLAB folder:

1. Download the project ZIP.
2. Extract it to any local folder.
3. Open MATLAB.
4. In MATLAB, either:
   - set the extracted project folder as the current folder, or
   - add the extracted folder to the MATLAB path.
5. Open the `ReactorApp toolbox` folder inside MATLAB if needed.

You can launch the non-ideal app in either of these ways:

### Direct launch

Run:

```matlab
NonIdealReactorApp
```

### Launch through the original main window

Run:

```matlab
ReactorApp
```

Then open the non-ideal branch from the main window by selecting the corresponding non-ideal reactor option.
